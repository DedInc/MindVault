# MindVault 🧠📚

<div text-align="center">

Welcome to MindVault, the ultimate Java application for efficient and personalized learning! 🎉 MindVault is designed to
help you maximize your learning potential while minimizing the risk of overtraining and mental fatigue.

## Features ✨

- 🎯 **Eliminating "mush" in the head (overtraining)**: MindVault adapts the learning process to your individual needs,
  monitoring your progress and preventing excessive repetition of already learned material. This allows you to focus on
  new information and maintain mental clarity.
- 🧩 **Full adaptability based on the speed and correctness of your responses**: MindVault dynamically customizes the
  learning process based on your performance. The application takes into account the speed and accuracy of your
  responses when determining the difficulty and repetition rate of flashcards, ensuring an optimal learning pace that
  matches your ability and progress.
- ⏰ **Interval repetitions to eliminate the need to decide what to repeat**: MindVault uses an interval repetition
  algorithm to automatically determine the optimal repetition intervals for each flashcard. The application takes your
  performance into account and adjusts the repetition intervals accordingly, eliminating the need for you to decide
  which flashcards to repeat and when, reducing the associated hassle and uncertainty.
- 🎓 **The "set and learn" concept**: MindVault follows the "set and learn" concept, allowing you to focus on the
  learning process without worrying about the technical details. Simply set your learning goals and let MindVault handle
  the rest, providing you with a seamless and efficient learning experience.
